A code editor providing a visual aspect to coding rather than allowing a user to code just through keyboard input.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{3/16/23 Edits\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
At this point the editor is being made to directly translate blocks representing c++ code to actual c++ statements so that the project can be finished by the end of the semester. I could continue to take the editor in a direction in which I believe could be beneficial to programming, but that would take more time and effort than I have in this semester. After finishing what I need in order to get an A for my independent study, I think I will return to the start once again to try and rebuild the editor using the Recoil library so that components no longer need to worry about sending an update function down through its children to update a hook variable; Recoil can instead provide a sort of \char`\"{}global\char`\"{} state that all components can read and alter without having to send props down through every level. I believe this functionality would be extremely beneficial and make things a lot easier in the end if I ever continue creating this editor after my independent study is over. Right now, I do not plan to continue development, but perhaps the Recoil library could change my mind.   The changes implemented over the past week are as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item added Search\+: a file containing a list of block definitions to represent a variety of c++ functions. Hard coded because I could not think of an efficient way to dynamically create all possible c++ blocks
\item added get\+Blocks to Search\+: a method to use the current input and filter from the search bar to only return blocks that meet the search criteria
\item fixed various bugs\+: I can\textquotesingle{}t remember all of them, but I know of one existing bug. Sometimes typing into a \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} too quickly can delete the end character and replace it with the last typed character. I noticed that typing \char`\"{}int\char`\"{} too fast resulted in \char`\"{}it.\char`\"{} I believe this behavior to be due to the constant reconstruction of the Workspace component, which must occur every time the block\+List is updated. This is one example of what I believe the Recoil library will help with, since providing the Workspace\textquotesingle{}s block\+List as an atom will make it so that the Workspace as a whole does not have to be updated every time the block\+List is updated.
\item added File\+Writer\+: at this point, I think I know how to write to a file based on what I saw online, but I don\textquotesingle{}t know how to read from a local file. I created File\+Writer with the intention of using a \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} to provide a file name and a button that upon being pressed will write the contents of the editor lines to the file. This is not ideal in the slightest, but I have no other idea of how to read and write to a file since the node\+:fs module does not work with Vite.

Blocks can now be properly translated into text in the corresponding line of the text editor. (After reading what I wrote on 3/6/23, it looks like I thought this was the case back then, but it was indeed bugged and needed to be fixed/improved.) The editor still cannot take text from an editor line and use it to edit a block in the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}. I spent a while trying to get this to work (and the pseudocode for this, with two different possible algorithms, is in the Helper.\+jsx file), but the algorithm is quite complicated. It involves knowing which index in the updated string was updated and which index of the values array of the block was updated, then updating the index of the values array accordingly. This may sound simple, but there are a lot of conditions that need to be checked during the algorithm, and that makes it hard to implement. I chose to wait on implementing the algorithm until I figure out how my blocks will translate into code. Right now I have it so that my blocks are one-\/to-\/one with the lines of the text editor, but depending on how I implement the blocks, it could be a one-\/to-\/many situation. For example, if I create a set block to perform the action \char`\"{}set variable = value;\char`\"{} then I could translate that to \char`\"{}int variable; variable = value;\char`\"{} if that\textquotesingle{}s how I choose to implement the blocks.   Other than the translations, I added the ability to click on a block in the \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone} and replace the corresponding line of the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} with the selected block. Drag and drop would\textquotesingle{}ve been much more complicated to implement as the User\+Inputs within the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} would\textquotesingle{}ve had to use an allow\+Drop function (to use event.\+prevent\+Default() on dragover to ensure the block can be dropped) and an on\+Drop function to return the index of the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}\textquotesingle{}s block\+List to replace with the selected block. I saw this as redundant since the Workspace is already aware of which line is in focus using its own index hook variable, so I simply made it so that on\+Mouse\+Down selects the block from the \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone} and on\+Focus sets the corresponding index of the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}\textquotesingle{}s block\+List, which updates the Workspace\textquotesingle{}s index -- and through use\+Effect() -- updates main\textquotesingle{}s block\+Zone\+Selected. If \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}\textquotesingle{}s block\+List is called bz\+Values, clicking on a block in the drag\+Zone updates bz\+Values\mbox{[}block\+Zone\+Selected\mbox{]} to that selected block.   The list of blocks shown in the drag\+Zone is currently controlled by a list of block\+Lists called Search\+Blocks. The idea of Search\+Blocks is that each block\+List in Search\+Blocks contains a specific \char`\"{}type\char`\"{} of block. When a \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} is typed into, a variable called input is updated in main. The purpose of input is to determine which blocks to display in the drag\+Zone\textquotesingle{}s block\+List. Giving Search\+Blocks \char`\"{}types\char`\"{} can allow for a comparison with input to filter out blocks that the user may not need. Furthermore, the search bar in the drag\+Zone is also meant to be used for filtering blocks in the drag\+Zone block\+List. If input filters which block\+List in Search\+Blocks is used, the search bar will further filter results by selecting which blocks in that block\+List will be shown in the drag\+Zone\textquotesingle{}s block\+List. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{3/6/23 Edits\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
I was finally able to implement the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}\textquotesingle{}s block\+List. The block\+List can contain both Blocks and User\+Inputs. Typing in a \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} in the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} will edit the same corresponding line in the text editor. This capability is not ready to be implemented into blocks yet as blocks hold an array of strings while the text editor holds one single string, so something needs to be done in order to make sure the blocks can be translated from/to easily. The main problem with implementing the block\+List and ensuring it was directly tied to the editor was how to manage the storage of data. The data could not be stored within the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} or Editor directly because the two components need to know about each other\textquotesingle{}s data so that one may update the other. Thinking back on it now, I\textquotesingle{}m not entirely sure if there was a reason why the block\+List couldn\textquotesingle{}t be a hook variable within the Workspace, but I know the block\+List will eventually be needed in main because the dragzone will eventually need to know about the block\+List in order to update it. I was able to make my approach work after a long struggle of figuring out how to design things. After running into an issue where my block\+List was updating correctly but the values displayed in my User\+Inputs were not, I thought about reading from/writing to files only to learn that the node\+:fs module cannot be used with Vite. (Reading and writing to files will eventually be needed since the goal is to create and store a program made with this editor, but I have yet to learn how to do so.) As I discovered today, the reason why my User\+Inputs (textareas) were not updating correctly was because I was setting their default\+Value instead of their value. The behavior this caused in my program is still strange and confusing to me; nevertheless, this simple -- yet hard to find fix -- fixed my components so that they could update correctly.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{3/1/23 Edits\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
Design is currently on attempt 4. Attempt 3 sought ease of use of React components by separating their data from their view through Controller classes. I ran into a wall when figuring out how to update both the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} and Editor with this design model. All blocks in the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} have a string representation (a value), and the lines of the editor are meant to be 1 to 1 with the value of each block in the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}. As such, when the value of a block in the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} is updated, the value of the lines in the Editor should match; however, with separate Controller objects for the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} and Editor, I could not get this functionality to work due to the fact that changing the data stored in an object does not trigger React\textquotesingle{}s update functionality since a plain JS object is not a React Component. Seeing no way to make this functionality possible with design attempt 3, I tested design attempt 4. I tried to hold onto the idea of controllers with design attempt 4, but they were really just performing the same function as the actual component (since the controllers were React Components as well) so I just got rid of them. I was able to figure out that with all objects being React Components (this time made using hooks instead of classes) that I needed the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} and Editor to share the same state, so I made them both hooks within a Workspace Component. This provided me with the functionality I was seeking (being able to update the Editor with an update to the Blocks in the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}), but a new problem arised\+: how to add new blocks to the list of blocks in the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}. I want to be able to add a block when the user presses enter within the textarea of a block in the blockzone, but the problem is that my list of blocks is in my Workspace Component, and the textarea is within the \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} Component that is within the \doxylink{classBlock}{Block} Component that is in a list within the Workspace Component.   Visually\+: Workspace\+: blocks = \mbox{[}\doxylink{classBlock}{Block}\mbox{]} -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} textarea   So how is an enter key press within the textarea supposed to append a block to \char`\"{}blocks\char`\"{} all the way up in the Workspace Component? Especially since I can\textquotesingle{}t pass the list of blocks to each \doxylink{classBlock}{Block} in the list, so I can\textquotesingle{}t send the list of blocks themselves down the hierarchy. Hmm...\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{2/16/23 Edits\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
Created the code for the interface after following the pseudocode. Some of the pseudocode could not be implemented as intended, and for some of the code, the way the code works is undesirable. For example, the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} uses a \doxylink{classLinkedList}{Linked\+List} of User\+Inputs to create the textareas for blocks to be placed within the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}. Pressing enter appends a new line to the end of the linked list no matter what line is currently selected. An approach is currently being thought of to fix this behavior, with the desired behavior being a new line being inserted immediately after the selected line (ex. if the user is currently on line 2 and the user presses enter, a new line should be inserted between lines 2 and 3, with the new line number being updated to 3 and all subsequent lines having their line numbers updated respectively.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{2/15/23 Edits\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
The repository now contains a pseudocode design for the interface via src/main\+Psuedo.\+txt, src/\+Block\+Psuedo.\+txt, src/\+Block\+Zone\+Pseudo.\+txt, and src/\+Drag\+Zone\+Psuedo.\+txt. block\+Visualization.\+cpp shows the original thought process of how the blocks will work by showing comments for respective c++ statements; however, a new approach to creating the blocks has made the old thought process obsolete. \char`\"{}\+Dividers\char`\"{} will no longer used\+: blocks will consist of \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} (textareas) and Extenders (textareas). \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} textareas provide an area to place \char`\"{}terminal\+\_\+blocks\char`\"{} that can be dragged from the dragzone and placed within the block. The terminal\+\_\+block is \char`\"{}absorbed\char`\"{} by the parent block as the parent block appends the html elements. Extender textareas also provide an area to place terminal\+\_\+blocks, but upon placing a terminal\+\_\+block within the Extender (or providing the Extender with text input), a new Extender will be appended to the block to allow the block to represent a programming statement of variable length; the statement will only end when an end\+\_\+statement block is placed into the Extender. For example, in C++, this end\+\_\+statement block will be a semicolon. The hope with this design is that any programming statement can be created with an initial block containing a \doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input} textarea and Extender textarea, given that the \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone} provides the terminal\+\_\+blocks to use. The \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone} will contain many predefined blocks to choose from, along with a textarea used to search for the exact block to use (also containing filters to help aid the search). There will also be blocks generated from the program, too, such as variable blocks and functions. Ultimately the usefulness of this interface will be dependent on how helpful the \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone} is when searching for blocks.

An example using C++\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Start\+: \mbox{[}\doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input}\mbox{]} \mbox{[}Extender\mbox{]} // Format of the initial block
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item int$\ast$ \mbox{[}\doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input}\mbox{]} \mbox{[}Extender\mbox{]} // The user places an \mbox{[}int$\ast$ \mbox{[}\doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input}\mbox{]}\mbox{]} terminal block into \mbox{[}\doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input}\mbox{]}
\item int$\ast$ variable \mbox{[}Extender\mbox{]} // The user types the name \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} into \mbox{[}\doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input}\mbox{]}
\item int$\ast$ variable = \&\mbox{[}\doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input}\mbox{]} \mbox{[}Extender\mbox{]} // The user used an \mbox{[}= \&\mbox{[}\doxylink{classUserInput}{User\+Input}\mbox{]} \mbox{[}Extender\mbox{]}\mbox{]} block
\item int$\ast$ variable = \&var2 \mbox{[}Extender\mbox{]} // The user types var2 for the second variable name
\item int$\ast$ variable = \&var2; // The user ends the statement using the end\+\_\+statement block.

The repository now contains the code I have created for the interface so far (not all of it, my previous attempt at using electron has not been uploaded). The repositor now contains the Test\+App directory. This is the directory I will be using to build the application (I have yet to come up with a name for the application, so I will refer to it as the Visual Text Editor (VTE)). All testing will be done in the Test\+App directory. When the final version of the VTE is ready to be created, I will create a directory specifically for the final version.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Test\+App Directory (2/10/23)\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item block.\+css\+: style definitions for div classes representing blocks. This was created earlier on and is not up to date.
\item blockspace.\+html\+: a separate html file that may be used to implement the Block\+Space as an iframe in index.\+html. The only benefit I believe this would provide is the ability to behave like its own webpage within another webpage (The advantage being a scrollbar\+: if so many blocks are added that the blocks go off the screen, then the page automatically reacts by adding a scrollbar so that all elements can be viewed.). The disadvantage of using iframes is that I do not know if this will complicate the transfer of data from one view to another. For example, if the sidebar (the \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone}) and the Block\+Area are both iframes, then how will drag and drop be affected by the two views being iframes? Will it even have an effect? This is something I have not tested, so I am unsure if this is anything to be concerned about or not. At this point, I have no plans to use iframes, so this file is useless at the moment.
\item index.\+html\+: the main html file that controls the view. Bootstrap is also added to apply styles to elements easily through classes.
\item package-\/lock.\+json\+: I believe this file is created after npm install is used to install a package. Not entirely sure of its use.
\item package.\+json\+: metadata about project, such as author, license, and commands used by vite for development such as a command to run the application.
\item sidebar.\+html\+: a separate html file meant to be used in the same way as blockspace.\+html, this time for the sidebar where blocks are dragged from. (So far, unused since I don\textquotesingle{}t know if iframes will be used.)
\item vite.\+config.\+js\+: a config file for vite.
\item src\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Block.\+jsx\+: a file defining React components used for Blocks. The plan is to have a \doxylink{classBlock}{Block} class and have each type of block extend the \doxylink{classBlock}{Block} class.
\item Block\+Zone.\+jsx\+: the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} is the area where blocks will be combined together to represent code. The base of the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone} is a text editor where the root line of the text editor is a React component. The root line cannot disappear and is the holder that keeps following lines in place. New lines are added to the text editor by adding React components to the root line as children. Currently, the root line stores a list of all \doxylink{classNewLine}{New\+Line} children. A new line is added to the root line\textquotesingle{}s list of \doxylink{classNewLine}{New\+Line} children when an enter is pressed while typing within a \doxylink{classNewLine}{New\+Line}\textquotesingle{}s textarea. Textareas, a React component called \doxylink{classCreateForm}{Create\+Form}, is a form containing a textarea with the ability to add New\+Lines. There is currently no capability to remove New\+Lines by pressing backspace on an empty line because the process of creating New\+Lines can be improved. A divider is a component used within a block, such that a block is created from dividers and textareas (a divider simply stores a \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}p\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} containing text). A \doxylink{classDropZone}{Drop\+Zone} is my attempt at creating an area for blocks to be dropped and shown on a \doxylink{classNewLine}{New\+Line}. A \doxylink{classDropZone}{Drop\+Zone} currently adds the inner components of a \doxylink{classBlock}{Block} and not the \doxylink{classBlock}{Block} itself; thus, Blocks can only be dropped into the droparea and cannot be removed.
\item Drag\+Zone.\+jsx\+: this is the area that should probably be called the sidebar. This is the area where blocks are supposed to appear after the user types in the \doxylink{classBlockZone}{Block\+Zone}\textquotesingle{}s current line. Blocks will appear and the user can drag them from the \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone} to the Block\+Area.
\item main.\+jsx\+: at the moment, creates the Monaco editor and initializes the root line of the Block\+Area and \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone}. In the future, will most likely control communication between Block\+Area and \doxylink{classDragZone}{Drag\+Zone} components (if necessary) and communication of block data to the Monaco editor and vice versa.
